### Conclusion
- Most patients do not undergo Glucose or A1C Test and do not get diagnosed with Diabetes. Hence, It gets difficult to determine whether diabetic patients are at higher risk of readmission or not.
- Conversely, data says that people already taking diabetes medication have been readmitted.
- Most significant predictor variables: n_inpatient, n_outpatient, diabetes_med, n_emergency, time_in_hospital, age
- Hospitals should follow up on the diagnosis and glucose test reports for patients already under diabetes medication to further analyze whether the patients are at higher risk of readmission.

#### Diabetes cannot indicate higher readmission rates.
